The main focus of the lesson was pseudo-code (back to that later). In order to demonstrated the usefulness of writing pseudo-code and to practise doing so, we were given the task of writing a JS function. The instructions were as follows: 
    - Write a program that prints each number from 1-20 on a new line
    - For each multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number
    - For each multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number
    - For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

I hastily wrote the pseudocode and the code but had a problem: for 15 the function outputted "fizz" "buzz" and "fizzbuzz". I then corrected my code by making it so that if a number was divisible by 3 and not divisible by 15, the output should be "fizz". 

I then saw a classmate's code which was similar to mine but much more concise. It started with "if divisible by 15, output 'fizzbuzz', else if divisible by 3....etc"

Important lessons: 
- think about order when pseudocoding. It doesn't have to be in the same order the task is given in.
- try to anticipate possible problems when pseudocoding. It's obivous to a human that the output for 15 should be only fizzbuzz, but that needs to be explicit in the code.
- there is a difference between "if......., if....." and "if......else if....."
