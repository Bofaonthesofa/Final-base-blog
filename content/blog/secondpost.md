After trying several YouTube tutorials I finally had a eureka moment when watching the Kevin Powell (see previous blog post). I realised that there was an input and an output and that Eleventy generated the input when you entered "npm start" in the terminal. 
In fact, even more basically, I learnt that there is a terminal in VS Code that you can use and this seems to be miles easier.

I learnt that you seem to choose your commands for the terminal in the package.json file. I learnt that you get this file by running 'npm init -y' in the terminal. You then change the "script" commands. I used '"start": "eleventy --serve"'. 

I then learnt that to control the input and output you write a .eleventy.js file and specify them in some fairly straightforward JS. I just copied the JS from the Kevin Howell video.
