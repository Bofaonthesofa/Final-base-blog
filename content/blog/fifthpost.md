After finally getting my Eleventy site to work, including my form etc, I simply had to deploy the site using Neflify. Not so simple. I tried but I kept getting the error: "Deploy failed due to an error in @netlify/plugin-lighthouse plugin.” 

I probably took me too long to find the error message and Google it. Even when I did, I didn't find anything useful even though some solutions seemed relevant. Eventually I just asked an experienced programmer and got the solution right away. 

So, things that I should have done: <br>
    - identify the error message as soon as possible in order to make the search as focused as possible <br>
    - analyse the problem: <br>
            ± what exactly are you trying to do? <br>
            ± how are you trying to do it? <br>
            ± what exactly is happening? <br>
            ± why is it happening? <br>
                ± what cannot be the cause? <br>
