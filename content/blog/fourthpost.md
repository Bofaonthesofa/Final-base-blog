Just when you think you are making progress, something always happens and I just get completely stuck. Why on earth won't it copy over the fourth blog post? As far as I can see, the md file is exactly the same as the other md files which have copied over just fine.

In the end I just had to delete it and start again. I have no idea why it wouldn't copy. I thought it was something to do with it being an 'untracked' file but I don't think that was it.
