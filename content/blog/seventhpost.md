title: Basic Javascript part 1

For this week's task we had to write a simple programme in JS. This was fairly straightforward and, for the first time since early on in the course, I was able to complete a task with no problems. 

I then wrote a JS function to calculate the tip. I had to check a couple of things that I had forgotten about JS funcctions but again this was fairly straightforward. 
The main problem I had was rounding the result to two decimal places. I was trying to use mathRound() at first before I vaguely remembered something about toFixed(). A quick Google search solved the problem. It was only later that I realised the task specified using toFixed(). <strong>Simple lesson: read the instructions. </strong>

I also had a problem with //return final.toFixed(2)//. I can't remember why. 

So, finding myself in the unusual position of having finished my tasks in good time, I decided to try something a bit more ambitious. I thought that if you are writing a bit of code like this, it is likely to be customer-facing. For this reason the customer should be able to simply input the values of bill and the tip proportion without having to access code. The only way I knew how to do this would be to use a   .njk file....
