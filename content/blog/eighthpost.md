title: Basic Javascript (part 2)

It took me quite a while to get my head round this. I really didn't know how to work with JS, njk, and HTML. I easily found some basic code on W3 which covered most of what I wanted. I was very vaguely familiar with //getelementbyID// and inner HTML but I had no idea how to use them.

Anyway, then came the hard bit: how to put it in a .njk file so that it would work when entering values on the .md file. In the end the answer was kind of obvious. If I had simply thought more logically and carefully about punctuation, I would have found the answer more quickly. I also made a simple oversight with the punctuation of template literals for the first task. 

<strong>Simple lesson: pay attention to punctuation. See the logic of it. Presumably it is all necessary and as simple and user-friendly as possible. <strong>
